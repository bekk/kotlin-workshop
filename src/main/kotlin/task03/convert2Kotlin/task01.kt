/**
 * Task 1: Converting Java to Kotlin v1
 *
 * IntelliJ has built in support for converting Java code to Kotlin, and one way is to convert an entire file.
 * One way to do this is to bring up the context menu by right-clicking on the file in the left column, then click
 * "Convert Java File to Kotlin File".
 * Another way is through your new best friend - CTRL + ALT + SHIFT + K / CMD + OPTION + SHIFT + K
 *
 * TODO: Test it out on the class Company.java. Right click on the class and select "Convert Java File to Kotlin File"
 *
